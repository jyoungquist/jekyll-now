title: About Me
---

I am a second year computer science PhD student at the University of Florida, working under [Dr. Jorg Peters](cise.ufl.edu/~jorg).  I am currently working on a small [DARPA TRADES](https://www.darpa.mil/program/transformative-design) team focused on designing microstructure for 3d printing that is inspired by observations from nature, using tools from a diverse set of mathematics including algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and numerical analysis. 

Apart from 3d printing, I have interests in computer graphics, curves and surfaces, algorithms, and CS theory.  I also have a laymans interest in philosophy and theology, read as often as I can, and enjoy working out.
